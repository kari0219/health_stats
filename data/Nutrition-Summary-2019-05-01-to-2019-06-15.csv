* Consistency is the best predictor of weight loss (11min)

Is it worth it?

One thought:
* Exchanging food for leanness (35min)
   - this is not a long term view and is not sustainable.
  - until you are at the extreme point of BF, this is not the long term view
* Instead of reducing quantity of food (highly caloric), add more nutrient dense

Example: whole eggs might be fine at some bodyfat, but then at some point may need to swtich out for a bit. (37min)

Female BodyFat Range:
* metabolism is more resistant, so can go up to 30% and be healthy.
* more of a conscious choice.

Your goal is to beat that weekly low the following week. Typically this new weekly low will be on Thursday or Friday. The goal is to equal or get close to equal of your previous weekly low by Wednesday.

By Wednesday, your body should be depleted of glycogen due to Monday and Tuesday's calorie burning cardio sessions. If Wednesday's weight is substantially more than the previous week's weekly low, then a few things could be happening:
___ Monday and Tuesday's workouts didn't deplete all the muscle glycogen.
___ You have possibly gained a bit of body fat.
___ You may have gained a bit of muscle.

The majority of the time, it is simply a matter of having a bit of glycogen left in the system. I would recommend a similar glycogen depletion workout like Monday and Tuesday's workout. Even if it is body fat, it makes sense to add in a rough max-calorie burning session.

Previous Low Weight Low: 176.2.
If Weight Less than PLW:
- Steady State Zone 2 Cardio
If Weight > PL :
- Tempo Intervals

Your goal is to beat that weekly low the following week. Typically this new weekly low will be on Thursday or Friday. The goal is to equal or get close to equal of your previous weekly low by Wednesday.

By Wednesday, your body should be depleted of glycogen due to Monday and Tuesday's calorie burning cardio sessions. If Wednesday's weight is substantially more than the previous week's weekly low, then a few things could be happening:
___ Monday and Tuesday's workouts didn't deplete all the muscle glycogen.
___ You have possibly gained a bit of body fat.
___ You may have gained a bit of muscle.

The majority of the time, it is simply a matter of having a bit of glycogen left in the system. I would recommend a similar glycogen depletion workout like Monday and Tuesday's workout. Even if it is body fat, it makes sense to add in a rough max-calorie burning session.
